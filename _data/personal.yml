intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
    I am a PhD student in the [Mathematics department](https://www.math.uwo.ca/) at the University of Western Ontario.
    My supervisor is [Dr. Hristo Sendov](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/people/bios/hristo-sendov.html).
    I loosely work in the areas of non-smooth optimization and geometry of polynomials.
